# Description: Processed and feature-engineered data for model input.
# Pre-processing Steps:
# 1. Merged stock data with forward-filled macroeconomic data.
# 2. Calculated daily returns, 50-day rolling average, and GARCH(1,1) volatility.
# 3. All numerical features are normalized using Min-Max scaling to a range of [0, 1].
# 4. Missing values from initial rolling calculations are dropped.
